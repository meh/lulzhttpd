Use threads instead of fork, because fork is faggotree.

Think about a good way to put all the #ifs for portability in a file only.

Server waits and creates threads to serve the faggots.

Server has objects: Config, PluginList.

Object list:

Server - The main part of the program.
Config - Parse the xml config files etc, use it like in lulzBB, Config::get(conf, domain) or something like that.
Plugin - Loads the plugin from the file and sets the various stuff in it.
PluginList - A list with plugins etc.
Socket - Well, i don't want defines here and there, so this is needed.
HTTP - The object that does the http stuff.
